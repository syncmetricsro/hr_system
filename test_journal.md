Phase 1 foundation slice checks (auth, RBAC, localization, audit).

Checks run:
- Generated `accounts`/`audit` migrations via `manage.py makemigrations` inside the digest-pinned app image (no models missed; both `0001_initial` created).
- `ruff check apps config scripts tests manage.py` passed in the hash-pinned test image (with `RUFF_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/ruff`).
- `pytest tests/test_shell.py tests/test_rbac.py tests/test_auth.py tests/test_audit.py` — **32 passed** against a digest-pinned PostgreSQL 17 container using the hash-pinned test lock, settings `config.settings.local`.
  - RBAC: `can()` matches the matrix per role/action; anonymous denied all; `ROLE_ACTIONS` is the consistent inverse of `ACTION_ROLES`; every `Action` is mapped; `require_action` redirects anonymous, raises `PermissionDenied` for the wrong role, allows the permitted role.
  - Auth: login success/failure, logout redirect, login writes an `auth.login` audit event, manager sees the gated "Spravovať projekty" button while observer does not, language switch resolves the `/hu/` prefix, dashboard requires login.
  - Audit: `record_event` writes rows (actor/target/metadata); anonymous actor stored as `None`; updating an existing `AuditEvent` and deleting one both raise `AuditError`.
- `docker build -t jober-platform:phase1 .` passed (collectstatic ran with the new apps/templates).
- `scripts/check_no_node_artifacts.py` passed; `scripts/check_production_image.sh jober-platform:phase1` passed (no Node/Tailwind binary in runtime).
- `scripts/playwright_smoke.sh` (APP_IMAGE=jober-platform:phase1) — **4 passed**: it now seeds demo users, the mobile shell logs in then loads the field queue, the health endpoint returns `ok`, the login page renders, and the app root bounces unauthenticated visitors to login. App container ran with `DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=0`/`DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=0` because the internal smoke network is HTTP-only.
- Verified seed data is fictional only (`@demo.jober.test`); no real PII.

Follow-up (2026-06-21) — static serving fix:
- Regenerated `runtime.lock` and `test.lock` in the digest-pinned Python image with `whitenoise==6.12.0` (transitive `certifi`/`greenlet` pinned back so the diff is WhiteNoise-only).
- Rebuilt `jober-platform:phase1` and `jober-platform-playwright:phase1`.
- `ruff check` clean; **unit tests 32 passed** (no warnings after moving WhiteNoise to production-only settings).
- **Playwright smoke 5 passed**, including the new `test_static_css_is_served` (stylesheet returns `200 text/css`).
- `check_no_node_artifacts.py` and `check_production_image.sh jober-platform:phase1` passed.
- Verified against the live local stack: `app.css` serves `200 text/css` with a fingerprinted (manifest) filename.

Follow-up (2026-06-21) — production admin path:
- Added `tests/test_ensure_superuser.py` (create, idempotent re-run, repair of a demoted account, error when env unset, `--skip-if-unset`). **Full unit suite 37 passed**; ruff clean.
- Verified `ensure_superuser` in the rebuilt production image: create → "Vytvorený superuser", re-run → "už existuje a je v poriadku", no-env `--skip-if-unset` → skipped cleanly.

Expected current gaps:
- Translation catalogs not compiled (gettext tooling deferred); non-default languages fall back to Slovak source strings.
- Dokku staging still pending external server/domain/DB-service details.

## 2026-06-17

Phase 0 static/supply-chain checks.

Checks run:
- `python3 scripts/check_no_node_artifacts.py`
- `python3 scripts/verify_vendor_assets.py`
- `python3 -m py_compile manage.py config/asgi.py config/wsgi.py config/urls.py config/settings/base.py config/settings/local.py config/settings/production.py apps/core/apps.py apps/core/views.py scripts/check_no_node_artifacts.py scripts/verify_vendor_assets.py`
- `git diff --check`
- `TAILWIND_BIN=/home/disane/.local/bin/tailwindcss TAILWIND_SHA256=73f0e5459054e5cfaa8ab6f3b940f3fbe0f13cc7fd83bc24e7c655033c203400 scripts/build_tailwind.sh`
- Official Tailwind Labs `v4.3.0` `sha256sums.txt` was checked. The local `tailwindcss-linux-x64` binary matched the official SHA-256.
- Docker Tailwind build-stage verification passed during image build.
- `scripts/check_production_image.sh jober-platform:phase0` passed, confirming no Tailwind binary or Node/npm artifacts in the runtime image.
- `scripts/ci_phase0.sh` passed. This runs the no-Node scan, vendor checksum verification, Python syntax checks, `docker build --no-cache`, and runtime image artifact check. The no-cache build exercised the Tailwind official-checksum verification stage.
- `scripts/playwright_smoke.sh` passed. It uses `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.60.0-noble@sha256:8ff591d613b01c884cc488339ed4318b4513eaf0c57a164a878ba49e70e3f384`, verifies no Node/npm-family binary on `PATH`, verifies `playwright==1.60.0` in the hash-pinned test lock, builds a non-root test-runner image, starts production app + PostgreSQL + browser runner on an internal-only Docker network, and runs `tests/e2e/test_shell_smoke.py` with Chromium.
- Negative guard check passed: `scripts/check_production_image.sh` exits non-zero against the digest-pinned Playwright Python test image and reports forbidden `/ms-playwright` browser files. The same script remains green against `jober-platform:phase0`.
- `scripts/dev_db.sh up`, `status`, `url`, `psql`, `reset --yes`, and `down` passed. The script created an internal Docker network, generated gitignored local credentials, kept PostgreSQL off the host network, provided containerized `psql` access, and used the digest-pinned PostgreSQL image.
- A loopback DB port was tested and removed from the helper because it was not reachable while the DB container was attached only to an internal Docker network.
- Runtime lock generated in Docker and verified with `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements/runtime.lock`.
- Test lock generated in Docker and verified with `pip install --require-hashes -r requirements/test.lock`.
- `docker build -t jober-platform:phase0 .` passed.
- `docker run --rm ... jober-platform:phase0 python manage.py check` passed.
- Temporary PostgreSQL 17 container accepted `python manage.py migrate --noinput` from the app image.
- Running app container returned `ok` from `/healthz/`.
- `pytest tests/test_shell.py` passed inside the digest-pinned Python container with the hash-pinned test lock.
- `ruff check apps config scripts tests manage.py` passed inside the digest-pinned Python container with the hash-pinned test lock.

Expected current gaps:
- Dokku staging remains pending until the staging app/domain/PostgreSQL service details are available.

- Opened `demo/index.html` directly in headless Chromium; the app rendered.
- Ran a Chromium DevTools Protocol interaction check through the full guided path:
  - sign in to dashboard;
  - decision 1 pauses Next until selected;
  - blacklist risk flag saves;

- Reviewed `test-artifacts/corvinum-phone.png`.
- Reviewed `test-artifacts/jober-desktop.png`.
- Reviewed `test-artifacts/jober-phone.png`.

Known issues:
- `test-artifacts/` contains generated screenshots, Playwright report files, and failure artifacts from an earlier failed run before the Jober role strip/layout fix. The final run passed.

## 2026-06-13

Language switch checks.

Static checks run:

Source separation:
- `grep -ri jober demo/corvinum/` returned no output.
- `grep -ri corvinum demo/jober/` returned no output.

Playwright results:
- Built the pinned Docker image with `docker build -f Dockerfile.playwright -t hr-system-playwright-tests:1.60.0 .`.
- Ran the suite with `demo/` mounted read-only, `test-artifacts/` writable, and network disabled.
- `language switch works in all builds` passed: internal, CorvinumEU, and Jober each switched to Slovak and Hungarian and showed translated primary headings.
- Full suite result: 9 passed.

Visual review:
- Re-opened the generated CorvinumEU and Jober desktop/phone screenshots after adding language controls.
- Confirmed no top-bar overflow in desktop screenshots.
- Confirmed Jober phone exposes Language directly; CorvinumEU phone keeps Language reachable through the menu drawer.

Known issues:
- Some deeper mock data/audit prose remains English by design. The spec now records that mock names, company names, dates, phone numbers, and audit data may remain fixed unless explicitly localized later.

## 2026-06-13

- `client language switch covers deeper operational screens` passed for CorvinumEU and Jober in Slovak and Hungarian.
- Full suite result: 10 passed.

Known issues:
- Names, company names, phone numbers, and fixed dates intentionally remain unchanged mock data. Client-facing UI prose, callouts, audit text, mobile labels, and module labels now translate in the two client builds.

## 2026-06-14

Coordinator role and answered-decision regression checks.

Static checks run:
- `node --check demo/internal/app.js` passed.

- `node --check tests/responsive.spec.js` passed.
- `node --check playwright.config.js` passed.
- Parsed `demo/internal/index.html`, `demo/corvinum/index.html`, and `demo/jober/index.html` with Python `html.parser`; passed.
- Scanned all three builds for persistence APIs, remote script/style URLs, remote URLs, CSS `@import`, `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and `sendBeacon`; no matches.

Source separation:

Playwright results:
- Built the pinned Docker image with `docker build -f Dockerfile.playwright -t hr-system-playwright-tests:1.60.0 .`.
- Ran with `demo/` mounted read-only, `test-artifacts/` writable, and `--network none`.
- Full suite result: 11 passed.
- New regression passed: Coordinator role removes HR/approval data from the DOM across internal, CorvinumEU, and Jober at 375px and desktop.

Verified behavior:
- Coordinator defaults to logistics views, not HR dashboards.
- CorvinumEU Coordinator exposes transport logistics only.
- Jober Coordinator exposes Operations logistics plus Accommodation and Equipment.
- Coordinator DOM does not include HR/approval screens or text such as blacklist, work test, manager approval, document queue, certificate metadata, Pohoda, hire status, or approval history.
- Transport capacity shows Enforce as the answered decision and blocks full vehicles.
- Certificate storage shows Dates only / metadata only as the answered decision.
- Demand model remains the only interactive A/B decision.
- No horizontal scroll at the tested widths; internal Jober/Coordinator was additionally checked at 1365px and 1440px.
- No console/runtime errors were detected by Playwright.

Visual review artifacts:
- `test-artifacts/internal-phone-coordinator.png`
- `test-artifacts/internal-desktop-coordinator.png`
- `test-artifacts/corvinum-phone-coordinator.png`
- `test-artifacts/corvinum-desktop-coordinator.png`
- `test-artifacts/jober-phone-coordinator.png`
- `test-artifacts/jober-desktop-coordinator.png`

Known issues:
- `shared_hr_platform_architecture.md` is still absent from the repo, so this implementation followed the pasted clarification.

## 2026-06-14

Decision drawer answered-state regression.

Additional check added:
- `answered product decisions appear in the decision drawer` verifies all three builds show Demand as unanswered, Transport capacity as `A - Enforce capacity`, and Certificate storage as `B - Dates only`.

Playwright result:
- Rebuilt the pinned Docker image and reran the suite with `demo/` read-only, `test-artifacts/` writable, and `--network none`.
- Full suite result: 12 passed.
